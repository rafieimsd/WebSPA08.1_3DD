# This is log regex for 'grepping' the IP Address and the
# actual non-existent URL.
#
# Note: this regex must have exactly two groups (i.e. two
# sets of brackets) the first one being the IP Address and
# the second being the HTTP GET request
#
# The following example access.log line:
# 192.168.1.65 - - [01/May/2011:00:55:40 +0100] "GET /YouCannotBeHereRightNow! HTTP/1.0" 404 225
# would yield back:
# 	192.168.1.65
# 	YouCannotBeHereRightNow!
